Semantic Versioning: Major.Minor.Patch

-   Major: Breaking changes with no backward compatibility (e.g., changing the panel structure, adding a new page)

-   Minor: Changes with backward compatibility script (e.g., changing a question key or its options)

-   Patch: Small changes that don't need a backward compatibility script (e.g., changing question wording)

Always include the migration script path and a brief note in the CHANGELOG entry
